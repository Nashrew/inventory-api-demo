Extremely Basic Hard Coded Inventory API Companion for Product API Demo

Instructions to build and run as a jar (from base directory):
  - $ ./gradlew bootJar
  - $ java -jar ./build/libs/(jarfile)

Alternatively (from base directory):
  - $ ./gradlew bootRun

Note - I had to run "$ chmod 755 gradlew" in a fresh ubuntu environment after cloning the repo to avoid permission issues
